# Jyotish AI Agent 🧿

A simple Vedic astrology chatbot built using Replit’s AI Agent.  
The bot collects basic birth details and responds with information from Indian (Vedic) astrology.

## ✨ What the app does

The app works like a small “Jyotish” assistant:

- **Collects user details**
  - First name and last name
  - Date of birth
  - Place of birth
  - Time of birth

- **Computes and shows**
  - Indian Lunar Sign (**Chandra Rashi**)
  - **Swami** (ruling planet of that Rashi)

- **Asks follow‑up questions**
  - “Do you want your horoscope for **today**, **this week**, **this month**, or **this year**?”

- **Displays a response**
  - A friendly horoscope message based on the selected time period and the user’s Rashi.

This project is primarily for learning AI agents, not for serious astrological advice.

## 🧠 What I learned from this project

- How to describe an idea in **natural language** and let an AI agent (Replit Agent) generate and evolve the app.
- Basic concepts of Vedic astrology:
  - What Chandra Rashi (Moon sign) means.
  - How each Rashi has a ruling planet (Swami).
- How a modern web app is structured into:
  - **Client / UI** (chat interface).
  - **Server / logic** (where inputs are handled and astrology information is generated).
- How to:
  - Run and test the app on Replit.
  - Publish the app so others can access it.
  - Export the project and put it on **GitHub** as a portfolio / assignment artifact.
